# RealisticOrdering
PlateUp Mod - RealisticOrdering
[Steam WorkShop Link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2937451307)

This is an early mod that will definitely need balancing. It is built for large menus, all of the sides/desserts etc. It removes the standard ordering system and introduces a more dynamic menu/ordering system that tries to build itself off logic with classic breakfast/lunch/dinner style menus, however customers can sometimes order sides or just desserts even. Multiple courses will be very common, and not everyone will order the same thing.

To enable in the pause menu Options -> Game Play -> Turn "Realistic Ordering" On
Defaults is off

Overview

* Currently no Twitch/Chef integration
* Currently a lot of effect cards (Double Helpings/All you can eat/etc) do nothing.
* Customer Hunger Level Mechanic
* Logical Menu Schedules (Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner)
* Only 1 display stand within a range of 10 blocks has any effect (30% chance)

* Hunger Mechanic
  * Hunger level ranges from 1-99
  * Customer assigned value based on random rolls up to 65
  * Customers are considered full when their hunger is above 75
  * Food value (Item Value) determines how "filling" it is

* Menu selection (Breakfast/lunch/dinner) assigned on time of day & random rolls
* Dish type (base/starter/side/dessert) assigned on time of day & rolls
